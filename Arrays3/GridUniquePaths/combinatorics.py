'''
Problem Statement: Given a matrix m X n, count paths from left-top to the right bottom of a matrix with the
constraints that from each cell you can either only move to the rightward direction or the downward direction.
'''
# ! We are taking exactly m + n - 2 steps to reach the end.
# ! We are taking (m - 1) downward steps and (n - 1) rightward steps
# ! Since we need an m+n-2 number of steps to reach the end among those steps if we choose n-1 rightward direction 
# ! or m-1 downward direction and calculate the combinations ( i.e: (m+n-2)C(n-1) or (m+n-2)C(m-1) weâ€™ll get the total number of paths.

    for i in range(1, r + 1):

# ? Time Complexity: O(m -1) or O(n - 1) i.e., O(m) or O(n). 
# ?                  We can choose ensure minimum time complexity, by calculating min(m, n). So C is O(min(m, n))

# ? Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any additional space
