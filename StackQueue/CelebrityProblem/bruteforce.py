Problem Statement:
A celebrity is someone who is known to everyone but does not know anyone. So, if you are a celebrity at a party, you will be known to everyone, but you wonâ€™t know anyone there.
This situation is represented in the form of an N x N binary matrix. So, every cell can either have a value of 0 or 1. If matrix[i][j] = 1, this means that the ith person knows the jth person.
You have to tell whether a celebrity is present at the party or not. If it is present, we also have to tell which element (person) is the celebrity.
