# ? Time Complexity of Naive Solution : O(n*n*r) ~ O(n^3), where n = number of rows, and r = column index.
# ? Reason: The row loop will run for approximately n times. And generating a row using the naive approach of variation 2 takes O(n*r) time complexity.
# ? Space Complexity of Naive Solution : O(1) as we are not using any additional space
# ! Note that the Naive approach is the combination of variation 1 and naive approach in variation 2

# ? Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n = number of rows(given).
# ? Reason: We are generating a row for each single row. The number of rows is n. And generating an entire row takes O(n) time complexity.

# ? Space Complexity: In this case, we are only using space to store the answer. That is why space complexity can still be considered as O(1).
